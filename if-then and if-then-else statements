# the if-then Statement 


the _if-then_ statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. it tells the program to execute a certian section of code only if a particular test 
evaluates to true. 
  
the _if-then-else_statement provides a secondary path of execution when an if clause evaluates to false.
